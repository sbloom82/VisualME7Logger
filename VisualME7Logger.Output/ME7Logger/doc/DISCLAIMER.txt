In short: 
The logger has been tested successfully as far as possible, but I can and will not 
guarantee that nothing bad could happen when using the software with your specific car. 

Please follow these steps with each new ecu/car combination before you start logging on the street/dyno:
1. Configure highest baudrate and sampling rate you wish to use in the logger configuration.
2. Try to start the logger at first while ignition is on but engine not running.
3. Next, try to start the logger while engine is running, but in idle gear.
4. Rev. the engine to redline in idle gear while the logger is connected & running.

If any of the above test steps leads to unexpected behaviour of your car/engine 
(well, only behaviour you do not see anyways :-)), then don't use the logger while driving.
